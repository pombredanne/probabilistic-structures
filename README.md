# probabilistic-structures

This notebook goes with my talk on probabilistic structures for scalable computing, which I delivered 
at DevConf.cz and DevConf.us in 2018.  You can also [read a blog post](https://chapeau.freevariable.com/2018/01/structures.html)
supporting the talk in Brno or [watch the US edition of the talk](https://youtu.be/b1QgLBOqLKM?t=5h24m39s).
